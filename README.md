# native_metal is LIVE at https://expo.dev/@gcrawley/native_metal

### This is the final assessment project from FEW_2.4 React Native with Javascript. 

## As per the instructions,  I took the following steps to build the app: 
    
    - Create a new React Native Project
    - Use React Navigation: Tab Navigation with two tabs, later integrated a third
    - Add icons using react vector icons
    - Use Flatlist to display Band Tab
    - Format and Style band cell, use flex, display band name and year formed on left, display country of origin and number of fans * 1000
        (i also added the style of metal in red font for each band (but had trouble getting them uniform for some reason)
    - Stats tab displaying totals for each category
    - Style your work
    - Conditional styles -> bands who have split up are shown in a darker hue with a line through the name, and would show a line if they're still together, however there's an error in the data provided so that's not working. 
    - Count the genres of Metal and display the count on the Stats screen (again, the error in the data prevented my code from working with this so i just counted them and displayed the number)
    - Display styles (genres) of Metal on its own screen and provide a 3rd tab to navigate there
